# Securing Data with Encryption Software
**Objective**: Explored encryption practices to secure data at rest and data in transit, comparing various encryption tools.

## Tools Used
- **VeraCrypt and BitLocker**: Tools for full-disk and file-level encryption.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secured data in transit.

## Key Concepts
- **Data at Rest vs. Data in Transit**: Comparison of encryption needs for static vs. transmitted data.
- **Encryption Tools**: Assessed software solutions for securing sensitive data.

## Lab Overview
1. **Data at Rest Encryption**: Configured and tested encryption tools to secure files and drives.
2. **Data in Transit Encryption**: Verified SSL/TLS functionality to protect data during transmission.

## Learnings
- Practical understanding of encryption for data protection.
- Comparison of tools for securing data in various states.
